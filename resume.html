                    Instructing girls and non-binary people from across the United States 
                    on coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Introducing code to high schoolers 
                    to help close the gender gap in the computer science field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practiced leadership, Zoom functions, worked with Repl.it as an IDE to 
                    instruct, and mentored young gender minorities while introducing them to the 
                    Computer Science field and all it has to offer.

                <p>
                    During this program, I worked with Riot Games, Ernst & Young, and AT&T to connect 
                    students with mentors, organize sisterhood events, and support sponsors with 
                    their events.

                    In this program, I got to learn basic p5.js through code-along sessions and 
                    practice with Google faculty, ending with a final project to showcase what 
                    I learned.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Worked collaboratively with students from across the United States through 
                    Google, became proficient in p5.js, and worked with Glitch as an IDE.

                    Traveled to Peru as a United States representative for a United Nations 
                    program to learn about the importance of educating women in lower developed 
                    countries through STEAM subject experiences. In the end, I created a prototype 
                    for a site to discretely aid in people finding help when in a domestic abuse 
                    situation.

                    During this program, I worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a setting with 
                    only Spanish, learned microbiology, and learned how education can help elevate 
                    LDCs.
